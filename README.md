# Multi-Threaded-Language-Detector
A College Assignment I was asked to do in java to show knowledge in UML Diagrams, Concurrency and Parsing of Files in good Speed and Space Complexity. The Concurrency is not great in this but the language detector works over all with the WILI Benchmark Dataset

It breaks up the Words into ngrams and marks them by key and value in a Concurrent Hash Map.
Below is a picture of the overview of what I was asked to do.
